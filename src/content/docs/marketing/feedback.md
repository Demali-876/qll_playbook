Marketing is also a feedback channel.  
What people engage with, what questions they ask, what gets ignored —  
all of it helps refine positioning, UX, onboarding, and even the product roadmap.

Track repeat questions and objections.  
These usually signal where messaging or onboarding isn’t clear.

Collect testimonials, quotes, and user stories —  
use them to sharpen value propositions and surface real-world value.

Monitor analytics, but don’t rely on numbers alone.  
Qualitative feedback is often more revealing in early stages.

Loop back with the product and dev teams regularly.  
Insights from community and content should inform what gets built next.
