People need reasons to stick around beyond the tech.
The goal is to create shared context and a sense of forward motion —
something people want to be part of.

Decide where the community lives and keep it active with substance.

Share updates frequently and transparently —
roadmap progress, setbacks, wins.

Feature builders, contributors, projects, or users using your product.

Make space for two-way participation:
open questions, polls, discussions, co-creation opportunities.

:::note
Let the community help shape the culture.
Pay attention to the language, rituals, and memes they naturally use.
