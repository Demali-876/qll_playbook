Plan for momentum, not just attention. A good launch strategy builds credibility and energy over time, it doesn’t rely on one announcement or one feature drop.

Define what “success” looks like at each phase — adoption, contributors, integrations, etc.
Identify existing networks to tap into — ecosystems, creators, early believers.
Plan a content cadence: what gets shared, when, and by whom.

:::note
Get internal alignment. The best launches happen when everyone knows the plan and plays their part.

#### Start with a phased approach

- Early access / build-in-public stage  
- Initial launch (public or gated)  
- Post-launch sustain (growth, education, collaborations)

#### For each phase, map

- Who you’re trying to reach  
- What you want them to understand or do  
- What assets and comms are needed to support that

## ✅ Checklist

- [x] Launch timeline with owners and dates  
- [x] Core content: landing page, blog, announcement post  
- [x] Distribution plan across channels  
- [x] Follow-up plans: post-launch content, contributor calls, growth loops

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns

> **Do not:**

- Launch with no follow-up plan  
- Rely only on a social post or one announcement  
- Ship landing pages without context or a call to action  
- Wait until launch week to align with legal/product
