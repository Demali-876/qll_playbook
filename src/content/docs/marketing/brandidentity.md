Design and tone signal intent.  
Good identity systems build recognition, trust, and emotional pull.  
They also help teams move faster by cutting down on ambiguity.

Your brand is more than the logo.  
It’s the impression people have when they encounter your project —  
on a timeline, in a wallet, or in conversation.  

It should create recognition, clarity, and energy.

:::note
Start small and consistent. No need for a full brand book early on, but document the basics:
:::

- Logo, color palette, and font system  
- Naming rationale (product, protocol, token, etc.)  
- Brand voice and tone — with example phrases  
- Visual examples: Twitter templates, blog format, deck slides  
- Where assets live and how to request/use them

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [x] Logo and visual assets stored centrally (e.g. Notion, Figma)  
- [x] Social templates consistent with site tone  
- [x] Naming decisions documented (with do/say + don’t/say list)  

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns

> **Do not:**

- Use conflicting names for the same thing  
- Use visuals that clash with the tone of voice  
- Make people hunt across Slack or Notion to find the latest logo
