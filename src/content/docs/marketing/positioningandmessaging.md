Start by locking in the fundamentals.

1. Who is this for?
2. What problem are we solving?  
3. What’s the shift we’re enabling in how people operate, build, or interact online?  

Get brutally clear on this before doing anything outward-facing.
:::note
Define a primary audience. Focus is key — especially early on.

Write a one-line explanation a non-technical person could repeat.

Align the team on a short internal narrative:
“This is what we’re building, this is who it’s for, and this is why it matters now.”

## Use non technical language

Return to this regularly. Messaging sharpens with usage and feedback.

Before writing tweets or designing a site, the team should be aligned on core messaging.  
This doc should live in Notion, Google Docs, or wherever the team can access and contribute.

It should include:

- **Primary audience** (and secondary if relevant)  
- **Problem statement**  
- **Value prop in plain language**  
- **One-line descriptor** (the elevator pitch)  
- **Core differentiators**  
- **Key phrases** (what we say) and **banned phrases** (what we don’t)  
- **Example Q&A**: “How is this different from X?”

## ✅ Checklist

- [x] Internal messaging doc created
- [x] Reviewed by product, legal, and founders
- [x] Shared with external-facing team (marketing, sales, design)
- [x] Version-controlled and dated for future updates

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns

> **Do not:**

- Maintain multiple versions of messaging across decks or websites
- Borrow buzzwords that don’t align with product reality
- Lead with features instead of the value or outcome
- Forget who this is for—write with real humans in mind
